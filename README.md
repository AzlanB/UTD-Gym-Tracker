# SE-3354-Project
Project for Software Engineering 3354

Hello everyone, if you are having trouble accessing the repository through your IDE, make sure when you create a new project, click the 
"Create project from VCS" or the "Get from VCS"

It will then ask for a URL or if your IDE supports it, it will ask for your Github log in. I will supply the URL or share the project with all of you on GitHub or through the discord chat.
